These tools work but are in very early development stages...

MASTER TODO:
  1. Put both files code into classes, less procedural crap.

pushToCloud.rb
This is for pushing a single file to Cloud FIles. You will need to edit the file and add your Cloud Files user and API Key. 
The script requires the Rackspace Ruby lib (available on github) to be installed. It also utilises log files in the default /var/log/ directory.
TODO: 
  1. Optional Log Files
  2. Better logging of issues
  3. User / APIKey as vars

syncToCloud.rb
Yet to be committed to github. Will sync an entire directory to a Cloud Files container based on file size.
TODO:
  1. Add support for file checksum
  2. Add conf file to store config values for both scripts.
  3. Finish file size comparison.
  4. Add delete support

Run each script with no params for instructions.
